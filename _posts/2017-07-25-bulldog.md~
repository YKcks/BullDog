### BullDog
The bulldog(Professional Robot)is a robust and versatile middle size platform designed outdoor operations. all-weather four wheel skid-steer,robot can climb stairs,slope,and manenuver directly to apoint of interest on rough road outside.the robot can be teleoperated,follow the leader or use GPS waypoint navigation.

Modular design and provide 5/12/24/48v power and reconfigurable I/O.make the robot easy to integrate serveral sensors (indoor/outdoor laser,cameras,3D cameras,inertial merasurement units,GPS...) and actuators(light weight robot arm,stereovision,pan-tilt units...).

Based on open-source and modular,ROS(http://www.ros.org).framework simplifies the software development and allows easy integration and reutilization of software components whether they are device drivers or state of the art algorithms in vision,SlAM,point cloud processing,grasping,planning,swarming,etc.
